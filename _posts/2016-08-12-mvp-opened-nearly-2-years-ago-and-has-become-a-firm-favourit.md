  MVP opened nearly 2 years ago and has become a firm favourite with the new
  locals who have taken over this trendy part of Dublin over the last 10 years.
  It offers sumptuous sandwiches during the day and world class cocktails
  (literally, the bar tenders compete and have won world competitions) by night.
  Of course they're more than happy if you just want to drop in for a pint of
  the black stuff. Upstairs gets a mix of various uses from yoga to chess
  nights. Overall you couldn't find a more relaxed place to enjoy a day or night
  out with your pooch, sipping cocktails or Guinness, without any of the
  pretentiousness of some other bars.
