  Pupp is a relatively new addition to Dublin 8. Opening in 2016 this café
  paints its colours firmly on its mast, Pupp is so supportive of dogs that it
  simply named itself after them. As soon as you walk in you realise just how
  well somewhere like this can work. Our European cousins are well used to
  taking their pups to cafés like this but sadly it's still not the norm in
  Ireland. Once you and your four legged friend are settled in you'll be greeted
  by hugely welcoming staff and you'll be soaked in the aroma of great food
  being prepared. Prices are keen, the food is wonderful and the staff
  incredibly friendly. What more could you
  want?https://www.facebook.com/PuppIreland
