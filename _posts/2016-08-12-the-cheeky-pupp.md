The cheeky Pupp

Pupp is a relatively new addition to Dublin 8\. Opening in 2016 this café paints its colours firmly on its mast, Pupp is so supportive of dogs that it simply named itself after them. As soon as you walk in you realise just how well somewhere like this can work. Our European cousins are well used to taking their pups to cafés like this but sadly it's still not the norm in Ireland. Once you and your four legged friend are settled in you'll be greeted by hugely welcoming staff and you'll be soaked in the aroma of great food being prepared. Prices are keen, the food is wonderful and the staff incredibly friendly. What more could you want?
